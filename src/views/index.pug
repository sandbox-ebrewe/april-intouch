            strong With the worst of winter over, once again yardwork beckons. As you prepare to tackle outdoor projects, don’t forget to put safety ﬁrst. 
            | At least five business days before your shovel breaks ground, contact <strong>Ontario One Call</strong> to locate and mark utility lines on your property. They’re fast, their service is free and they’ll save you from costly – possibly dangerous – accidents. Here’s what you need to know:

          ol
            li It's against the law in Ontario to dig without having natural gas lines located. 
            li Digging or excavating could damage the network of hydro, gas, water and TV/telephone lines that may lie just below the surface of your property. 
            li Damage to these pipes or wires could create a safety hazard or shut down service to an entire neighbourhood until the system is repaired. 
            li Homeowners and/or their contractors are liable for damages, which could include a costly lawsuit if personal injury or property damage result.

          p For the past 10 years, while the cost of just about everything has gone up, natural gas has actually come down in price. In fact, despite recent rate increases, you’re saving up to $2,500 a year by using natural gas instead of electricity, oil or propane to heat your home and water. 
          p Massive deposits of natural gas right here in North America have resulted in record low prices, and experts agree that low, stable rates can be counted on well into the next decade. 
          p Meanwhile, electricity prices have basically doubled over the past few years. And if you’re using electricity during peak hours, time-of-use rates will push those costs even higher. 
          p Now and for the foreseeable future, choosing clean, affordable natural gas makes more sense – and saves you more money – than ever before.
